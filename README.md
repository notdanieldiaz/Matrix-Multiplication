# Matrix-Multiplication

## Goal
The goal is to write a program that can dynamically take in inputs as arrays and use them to form and multiply
matrices. Input can vary from user defined inputs on the command line or from other sources of arrays.

## Progress
intbMM() shows a basic integer multiplication being performed using basic 2-dim arrays. Possible and most likely 
better alternative is using vectors as they can dynamically change size unlike already initialized arrays.
